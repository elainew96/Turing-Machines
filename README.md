# Turing-Machines

Turing-Machines contains two turing machines, one that simulates a definite finite state automata with three states and two symbols in its alphabet, and one that reads in a graph encoding. The graph encoding turing machine takes in an input w , where w = {1,2,3,4,$,:,|}* and accepts the graph if there is a graph such that w = <G> and that <G> is the string consisting of the edges of G in lexicographic order delimited by colons.
